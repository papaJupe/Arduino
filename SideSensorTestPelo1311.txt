/* Range/Opponent Sensor Test 
   Assumes GP2Y0D810Z0F / http://www.pololu/product/1134
   This sensor outputs a digital on/off value. You'll need 
   to connect each of them to one of the arduino digital 
   inputs. 2 or 6 are good choices as they aren't being 
   used in our sumo-bots. Note: you may use the analog inputs
   as digital imputs. In this example two sensors are used;
   one connected to 2 and the other to 6.
   
   Hookup one of your sensor, black to ground, red to 5 
   volts, and white to digital 2 (or other unused input) 
   and the second sensor to ground, 5 volts, and digital 
   6. Compile and load this sketch into the arduino. Open 
   the Serial Monitor window. Start with your hand or some 
   other object about 20cm away from the sensor. Slowly 
   move toward the sensor observing the readings provided 
   in the Serial Monitor window. Do this for each side. 
   These sensors have a small led which will turn on when
   they are active. The output is HIGH when the sensor 
   sees nothing and goes LOW when something is between 
   10 cm and about 2 cm.
