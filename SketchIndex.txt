      adapted from Adafruit's _345 code for FRC accel breakout board to display 3 axis accel-
      erometer values (tilt).
      Uses: I2C, Wire lib, Adafruit unified lib, switch/case

    FRC board by AM. Read 3 axis accel values over I2C.
    Uses: I2C, Wire, I2Cdev, ADXL345 lib, anal pins to power device
    
ADXL345_test
    simple test to read single register from FRC accelerometer using I2C

    address of active device, then get its ID from reg 0x00
    Uses: I2C, Wire
    
AnalInputMap2ToneA-B-C
 input analog voltage, from pot or sonar, map to useful values, activate toner using beep
 rate and frequency to indicate distance (inversely); when target distance reached, stop tone and
 turn on a light; set adjacent analog pins (gnd, 5v, signal) to 0 and 5 v to power pot or US device
 mod A worked fine but long delays make loop execute very slowly when AR big;
 mod B uses timed event method to eliminate loop delays; much more complex logic, and tone quality
 suffers from beat frequency I guess
 mod C uses timedAction lib to make beeps run in their own thread so loop rate not affected; tone 
 quality is fine, and I can modulate beep rate in loop, and freq by setting it in beep().
 
 Uses (A,B,C): analogRead, tone, timing events w/ millis, print w/ String concat, sane print @ 
 count interval, TimedAction lib, map, constrain variable

ReadAnalogVaverage --  (expon moving) averages analog pin input, 0-5 v. (as from batt discharger 
   device with an op-amp); 
   maps that to the actual v. 11.5-13 being sampled; prints raw and calcul. voltage if it's changed; 
   can thus calculate params for map function 
   Uses: expon moving average, map, analRead
    
ReadAnalCurrMap - prints averaged analog pin reading when it changes; 
    from this calculates current across R-curr; if calib wrong, can find new params
    to use for map function.  Reads an analog input on pin X, and prints the result
    to the serial monitor if it has changed; uses mapping values to map pin AR to
    actual current (voltage/ 2 ohm) going to op-ampA.
    Uses: analRead, expon moving averag, map, round
    
ReadAnalogVaverage - averages analog input on pin X, calcul actual 0-5000mV, and prints
 the result to (ser. mon. +/- lcd if present) if it has changed; plot this against measured input 
 voltage by voltmeter. 
 Use to calculate mult or map for pin reading of voltage, checking various A pins, monitor
 batt discharge; added tone when dc target V reached for small < 5 v batts.
 Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to PinIn, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.
 Uses: Liquid Crystal 8x2 display, map, analRead, expon moving average, round, toner
    
ReadAnalogVaverage_3 -- averages (same) analog input to 3 pins X Y Z, and prints the result to 
    the serial monitor if it has changed.
    Used to calibrate and check op amp I/O params, compare accuracy of different AR pins
    based on: ReadAnalogVaverage - but using (same) voltage to 3 pins; 
    and here we're finding the multiplier for the op-amp part of batt discharger

ReadAnalogVaverage_Dig -  reads an averaged analog input on pin X, and prints the result 0-5000mV
    (+/- ser. mon. +/- lcd if present) if it has changed.  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer 
    to PinIn, and the outside pins to +5V and ground; or any analog source. 
    Also takes one hi/lo input to D3 and LED displays on/off from D8 -- used to test anal and dig
    IR sensors et. al.
    Uses: Liquid Crystal lcd, round, expon moving avg, flt to int cast, map
    
ReadAnalogVavg_Dig1602 -- reads an averaged analog input on pin X, and prints the result 
  0-5000mV (+/- ser. mon. +/- lcd if present) if it has changed. Attach the center pin of a 
  potentiometer to PinIn, and the outside pins to +5V and ground, or any other analog input.
  Uncomment key stuff to use keys.
  Also takes one hi/lo input to D3 and LED displays on/off from D11. Like ReadAnalVavgDig, 
  modif for 16x2 display
  Uses: Liquid Crystal libr, 16x2 display, DFR keypad libr, reading key value

ReadPoToPWM_A --  reads an analog input on pin A4, converts it to voltage, 
    and prints the result to the serial monitor if changed; sends scaled PWM 
    to digital pin. Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A4, and the 
    outside pins to +3.3V and ground.
    Uses: constant var, static, PWM output using analogWrite
    
ReadPoToPWM_B -- reads analog input on pin 0, converts it to voltage, proportional PWM output,
    and prints the result to the serial monitor when it changes. Very basic, could be improved with
    MA of voltage, rounding, faster loop.  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and 
    the outside pins to +5V and ground.
    Uses: float, cast to byte, PWM output with analogWrite
    
ReadSerialInteger -- takes number input from keybd, converts to int, converts from C to F temp
    Uses: Serial.parseInt
    
ReadSerialIntC -- takes mixed char input from keybd, extracts 1st int, converts from C to F temp;
  orig used Serial.parseInt which is weak at parsing int mixed with other chars, so 
  ReadSerIntB puts incoming digits into a String object then str.toInt() to convert. This v. C
  puts input bytes into char array, extracts first group of digits from it into another array then 
  uses atoi to make the int; memset clears array each loop  
  Uses: Serial.readBytes, atoi, isDigit, strlen, isDigit, memset

RGB Calibration test -- for Neopixel LED sets
// Use this sketch to determine RGB ordering for your chipset

SampleSyntax -- code examples of many kinds

   over serial.  Sends a header followed by two random integer values as binary data.
   Uses: random, lowByte, highByte, Serial.write, BIN format

Sensor Reader from Igoe MTT,ch.2,proj.2, added if block for handshaking w/ Proc.
 Context: Arduino -- later mods prep for sending batt dc readings to Proc

 mon. or ser. port -- to control pong game in Processing. Type any char+ret to
 trigger printing a string of sensor values, or send any byte from Proc.
 Connections: analog sensor(s) on 2 analog input pins (or pot simulates them)
 2 momentary switches on digital I/O pins
 
serialReadWriteAM1 -- AM revision of PY's for Ardu <-> SmartDesktop comm;

    code for strcat of float var; many questions about array use here
    Uses: char/string array, boolean input/output, Serial.readBytes
    dtostrf (vFlt,4,3,vStr) converts float to string,
    sprintf(tempstr,"%s;",vStr);   // put string into buffer
    strcat(out,tempstr)  // add buffer string to array
    
SerialReadWriteAM2   -- AM 2nd revision of PY's for Ardu <-> SmartDesktop comm
   v.2 adds float output & Streaming lib to print C++ style using insertions;
   reads digital and analog pin values, prints to serial output

   ? still have basic questions about what char arrays actually contain after strcat, sprintf

serialReadWriteAM3 -- AM 3rd revision of PY's for Ardu <-> SmartDesktop comm;
    digi & anal inputs & reading ser bool input to control leds; uses readBytes()
    to put full input string into char[], then for loop to read it, turn lites on/off
    my v. 2 added code for strcat of float var;  
    v. 3 tests various ways to re-init/clear the 'out' array each loop
    Uses: char/string array, boolean input/output, Serial.readBytes
    dtostrf (vFlt,4,3,vStr) convert float to string,
    sprintf(tempstr,"%s;",vStr);   // put numbers / string into ch array buffer
    strcat(out,tempstr)          // add buffer string to array
       
SeriPrintWrite -- to show output of ser.mon. using .write vs .print for a byte argument; 
      both show same char output in ser. mon. when the argument is a string;
      .write probably sends binary to serial port, but hard to see with ser.mon. or terminal
     as they both show the binary input as char's
      Uses: serial.write, serial.print

ServoMiniTrigger -- mod to use external trigger on interrupt 1 for sending servo pulses,
 so I can display on PC's screen in sync -- never got to work
 built from MotoKnobServo, to use 2 channel servo box, trigger from AD pixelPulse on PC
 mod for Nano uses Anal pins for ground/5v of pot; my defective nanos can't handle servo and Serial
 in same sketch!
 
StringToIntParse -- String to Integer conversion
 Reads serial input chars one by one, putting all digits (isDigit()) into a String; if input is Enter, 
 seen as a newline, then prints the String; Ser. Mon. must be set to send 'newline' for this to work.
 Simply parses all digits from input; not limited to size of int var.

  Uses: String object, Serial.read, .toInt, isDigit
